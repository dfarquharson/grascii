# Grascii

## TODO
- [x] hello world
- [x] hello ScalaTest
- [x] monoidal graph combination
- [x] parse `*.grascii` files into in-memory Graph (talk about the abandonment of parser combinators and the reasons for that)
- [ ] generate ascii art graphs from in-memory Graph
- [ ] ScalaCheck usage (especially on the draw function, as it asserts strong properties on an infinite domain and range)
- [ ] code coverage
- [ ] write alternative implementation in clojure
- [ ] write alternative implementation in python (toolz, hypothesis, pytest, pytest-cov)
